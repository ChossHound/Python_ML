Machine Learning, I CHOOSE YOU!

Pokemon is a well known franchise that has had a significant cultural impact on the entire world. This is especially true for individuals who were born 
in the 1990s through the early 2000s. Many fans will also recognize a game from the animated television program titled "Who's that Pokemon" that challenges 
viewers to guess one of the numerous pokemon species within the pokemon universe from a given silhouette. This project aims to not only tell who that pokemon 
is, but also secondary features like the pokemon's type, art style, feature design, and when it was released. The overall goal of the project is then to explore 
advancements in machine learning algorithms and image recognition to classify and describe the photos of pokemon in multiple types of media: anime, card art, 
video games, real-life, etc.
